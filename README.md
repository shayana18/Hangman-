# Hangman-
The game picks a random word from a list of words then using if statements checks if the user inputted
letter is in the word selected by using a for loop to check each letter of the word and then replace a list 
of blanks (the same length as the word) with the letter in its respective position. Lastly another four loop 
is used to continue asking the user to guess a letter as long as the hung man hasnâ€™t been build and there 
are blanks left in the word and adds a limb to the hang man drawing everytime they guess a letter not in 
the word.
